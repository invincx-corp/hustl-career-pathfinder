## **Why Landing Page Features Are Half-Baked:**

1. **No Real Data**: All components use mock/static data instead of real user data
2. **No Backend Integration**: Components don't connect to any backend services
3. **No State Persistence**: User interactions aren't saved or remembered
4. **No Real-time Updates**: No live data or real-time functionality
5. **No User Context**: Components don't know who the user is or their preferences
6. **No Business Logic**: Just UI components without actual functionality
7. **No Data Validation**: No proper input validation or error handling
8. **No Offline Support**: No offline functionality or data caching.

This roadmap provides a clear path from the current demo state to a fully functional production application. Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring a solid foundation before adding advanced features.
