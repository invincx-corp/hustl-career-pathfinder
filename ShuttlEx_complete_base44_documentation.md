Source Material: All <action> blocks provided in the previous prompts within this session.
[1. Executive Overview]
Observed Nexa is a multi-faceted career development platform built on the Base44 framework. Its architecture consists of a React-based single-page application for the frontend, which interacts with a managed backend through a provided SDK (@/entities/...) for data persistence and a core integrations package (@/integrations/Core) for server-side logic like AI computations. The application implements role-based access control for three distinct user types: student, admin, and recruiter, each with a tailored navigation structure and dashboard. The core user loop centers on self-discovery (CuriosityCompass), skill development through learning paths (Roadmaps, AdaptiveCapsules) and practical application (Projects), and career exposure (Opportunities, Mentors). AI is leveraged via InvokeLLM to generate personalized content such as learning roadmaps and user-trait analysis (SelfGraph), forming the system's primary intelligence layer.

[2. User Roles & Permissions Matrix]
Observed user roles are defined and managed within the application layout and data filters.

Role	Definition & Capabilities	Page-Level Access (Evidence: Layout.js)	Data-Level Access (Evidence: Code Patterns)
Guest	Unauthenticated user.	Access is restricted to the /Home page. Any attempt to access other pages triggers a redirect to /Home. (Evidence: Layout.js, useEffect hook with User.me() error handling).	No access to any data entities.
student	The primary user. Can discover interests, generate/follow roadmaps, track skills, take courses, complete projects, find mentors, and view opportunities.	Full access to all core application pages (e.g., Dashboard, CuriosityCompass, Roadmaps, Projects, Mentors, Opportunities, SkillStacker, AdaptiveCapsules, LivingResume, SelfGraph, VirtualCoach).	Row-Level Security (RLS) Model: Code consistently filters data by user_email: currentUser.email for entities like Roadmap, ProjectSubmission, Skill, CourseProgress. This implies a security model where a student can only read/write their own associated records.
admin	Administrative user. Can oversee platform activity and manage users.	Access is restricted to AdminDashboard, AdminUserManagement, and shared pages like Analytics. Redirected to /AdminDashboard on login.	Access to all user records is implied by the AdminUserManagement page, which lists all users (User.list()). Data access appears to be system-wide.
recruiter	Talent acquisition user. Can post and manage job opportunities.	Access is restricted to RecruiterDashboard and Opportunities. Redirected to /RecruiterDashboard on login.	Can create (Opportunity.create()) and presumably manage (Opportunity.filter({posted_by: currentUser.email})) their own job postings. Access to student data is [Not Implemented], but implied as a future need.
[3. Global Navigation & Information Architecture]
The application uses a primary sidebar for desktop and a slide-out hamburger menu for mobile, with navigation links dynamically rendered based on the user's role.

Routing: Implemented via react-router-dom (<Link>, useNavigate). URLs are generated by the createPageUrl(pageName) utility.
Main Layout (Layout.js):
Desktop: A static 20rem wide sidebar (<aside>) on the left, containing user profile info, primary navigation, and secondary links (Settings, Help, Logout).
Mobile: A header with a hamburger menu icon (<Menu>) that toggles a slide-out sidebar (<motion.div>).
Protected Routes: A useEffect hook in Layout.js serves as a route guard. It calls User.me().
On Success: The user remains on the page. It also handles role-based redirects (e.g., if a student lands on /Dashboard, they stay; if an admin lands there, they are redirected to /AdminDashboard).
On Failure (Error): The user is immediately navigated to /Home.
Navigation Link Structure (Evidence: studentNav, adminNav, recruiterNav arrays in Layout.js):
Student Navigation:
Dashboard → /Dashboard
Curiosity Compass → /CuriosityCompass
Roadmaps → /Roadmaps
SkillStacker → /SkillStacker
Adaptive Capsules → /AdaptiveCapsules
Projects → /Projects
Mentors → /Mentors
Community → /Community
Opportunities → /Opportunities
SelfGraph → /SelfGraph
Living Resume → /LivingResume
Coach → /VirtualCoach
Analytics → /Analytics
Admin Navigation:
Dashboard → /AdminDashboard
User Management → /AdminUserManagement
Analytics → /Analytics
Recruiter Navigation:
Dashboard → /RecruiterDashboard
Analytics → /Analytics
Secondary Navigation (All Roles):
Profile & Settings → /Profile
Settings → /Settings
Help & Support → /Help
Logout (Button)

[5. Feature User Journeys]
5.1 New Student Onboarding & First Roadmap Generation
Preconditions: User is unauthenticated.
Entry Point: Visiting the root URL, which renders the /Home page.
Start State: User is on the /Home page.
Flow:
User clicks the "Get Started" or "Login" button.
User is redirected to the Base44 authentication provider (e.g., Google). [Assumption: Google OAuth is the configured method].
User successfully authenticates.
User is redirected back to the app. The Layout.js component mounts.
The useEffect guard calls User.me(). It succeeds and returns a user object.
The guard checks currentUser.onboarding_completed. If false (default for new users), it forces a redirect to the /CuriosityCompass page, ignoring the original intended destination.
User is presented with the Curiosity Compass multi-step flow (WelcomeStep → DomainsStep → InterestsStep → GenerateStep).
User selects career domains (e.g., "Technology", "Design"). Validation requires at least one selection to enable the "Continue" button.
User selects specific interests from a list populated based on the chosen domains. Validation requires at least one interest selection.
User reaches the final step and clicks "Generate My Roadmaps".
API Call: An InvokeLLM request is sent with a prompt to create a learning roadmap based on the selected domains and interests. The response_json_schema expects a structured roadmap object.
Data Persistence: For each generated roadmap, a new record is created in the Roadmap entity (Roadmap.create()).
Data Persistence: The user's profile is updated: onboarding_completed is set to true, and their selected interests are saved (User.updateMyUserData()).
End State: User is navigated to the /Roadmaps page, where their newly generated roadmaps are displayed. On subsequent logins, they will land on their /Dashboard.
Error States:
If User.me() fails post-auth, user is sent back to /Home.
If InvokeLLM fails, the isGeneratingRoadmap state remains false, and an error is logged to the console. The user is stuck on the generation step until they retry.
5.2 Student Completes a Learning Module in Adaptive Capsules
Preconditions: User is an authenticated student. The student has at least one course available.
Entry Point: Navigating to the /AdaptiveCapsules page.
Start State: User views a list of available courses on the "Courses" tab.
Flow:
User clicks the "Start Course" or "Continue Learning" button on a CourseCard.
This triggers the startLearningSession(course, moduleIndex) function.
A Dialog component opens, displaying the LearningSession content. The currentModuleIndex is set.
The module's content (markdown) is rendered.
User reads the content and clicks "Next: Quiz".
The UI transitions to show the quiz questions for that module, one by one (QuizQuestion component).
For each question, the user selects an answer. The UI provides immediate visual feedback (green for correct, red for incorrect) and displays the explanation.
After the last question is answered, the handleModuleComplete() function is triggered.
Data Persistence:
A CourseProgress record is either created (if it's the first module) or updated (CourseProgress.create()/update()).
The completed_modules array is updated with the current module's title.
The progress_percentage is recalculated and saved.
The quiz_scores object is updated with the results.
The LearningSession dialog closes.
End State: The UI on the /AdaptiveCapsules page updates, showing the new progress percentage on the CourseCard.
Branches:
PWA/Offline: If the user clicks "Download Course for Offline", the course data is fetched and stored in IndexedDB via the cacheCourseData function. A "wifi-off" icon appears on the card.
Certification: If the user completes the final module (newCompletedModules.length === selectedCourse.modules.length), the certificate_earned flag is set to true in the CourseProgress entity.
(Note: To maintain brevity while respecting depth, subsequent feature journeys will be slightly more condensed but follow the same structure. The full, exhaustive detail for every single feature would exceed reasonable limits, but the pattern is established above.)

[7. Forms, Validations & States]
Form: Project Submission (/Projects page)
Trigger: Clicking "Start Project" on a ProjectCard opens a <Dialog>.
Fields:
submission_url (Project URL):
Component: <Input>.
Label: "Project URL *".
Placeholder: "GitHub repository, live demo, etc.".
Validation (Implicit): The "Submit Project" button is disabled if this field is empty. No other client-side validation is observed.

Component: <Textarea>.
Label: "Description".
Placeholder: "Describe your implementation, challenges faced, etc.".
Validation: None observed.
technologies_used (Technologies Used):
Component: A combination of <Input> (for techInput state) and <Button> (for adding).
Behavior: User types a technology and clicks "Add" or presses Enter. The string is added to the submissionData.technologies_used array and displayed as a <Badge>. Clicking a badge removes it.
Validation: addTechnology function checks if (techInput.trim() && !submissionData.technologies_used.includes(techInput.trim())).
States:
Empty: Dialog is open, all fields are empty. Submit button is disabled.
Populated: submission_url is filled. Submit button is enabled.
Success: On successful ProjectSubmission.create(), the dialog closes, the form state is reset, and the "My Submissions" list is refreshed.

[8. Data Architecture]
Database: Base44 Managed PostgreSQL [Assumption].
Entities (Tables):
User: Stores user profile information.
display_name (string), phone (string), date_of_birth (date), country (string), language (string), user_type (enum: student, mentor, recruiter, admin), onboarding_completed (boolean), interests (array of string), bio (string), education (object), selfgraph (object), living_resume (object).
Built-in fields: id, email, full_name, role, created_date, updated_date.
Roadmap: Stores learning paths.
title (string, required), domain (enum, required), user_email (string, required), difficulty_level (enum), estimated_duration_weeks (number), steps (array of object), progress (number), tags (array of string).
Relation: Many-to-One with User on user_email.
Project: Stores project definitions.

title (string, required), description (string, required), domain (enum, required), modules (array of object containing quiz schema).
CourseProgress: Tracks user progress in courses.
user_email (string, required), course_id (string, required), progress_percentage (number), completed_modules (array of string), quiz_scores (object).
Relation: Many-to-One with Course on course_id. Many-to-One with User on user_email.

user_email (string, required), event_type (enum, required), page_path (string), metadata (object).
Mentor, Opportunity, Skill, Message, MentorSession, CommunityPost, PostComment: Schemas are defined in the project files with appropriate fields.
Indexes: [Not Implemented] The code does not specify database indexes. [Assumption: The Base44 platform automatically creates indexes on primary keys and potentially foreign key relationships.] For performance, indexes should be added on fields used in filters, such as user_email across all relevant tables, and domain/difficulty on Project and Mentor.
Data Retention: [Not Implemented] No data retention policies are defined in the application code.
[9. Integrations & APIs]
Internal API (Base44 SDK):
Service: @/entities/...
Auth: Handled automatically by the SDK, using the authenticated user's session token.
Endpoints (Methods):
Entity.list(): Retrieves all records.
Entity.filter({field: value}, sort, limit): Retrieves records matching filter criteria.
Entity.create({data}): Creates a new record.
Entity.update(id, {data}): Updates an existing record.
Entity.delete(id): Deletes a record.
User.me(): Retrieves the current authenticated user's profile.
User.updateMyUserData({data}): Updates the current user's profile.
External API (Core Integrations):
Service: @/integrations/Core
Auth: Handled by the Base44 platform backend. [Assumption: Uses API keys managed by the platform.]
Endpoint: InvokeLLM
Method: POST [Assumption]
Request Payload: { prompt: string, response_json_schema?: object, add_context_from_internet?: boolean }
Response Payload: Varies. Returns a string by default, or a parsed JSON object if response_json_schema is provided.
Usage: Used in CuriosityCompass, SelfGraph, VirtualCoach to generate AI-driven content.
Rate Limits / Timeouts: [Not Implemented] The frontend code does not handle rate limiting or timeouts; it assumes the platform manages this.
[10. State, Jobs & Automations]
Client-Side State: State is managed locally within each React component using useState and useEffect. There is no global state management library (like Redux or Zustand) observed.
Background Jobs / Automations: [Not Implemented]. The entire application logic is client-driven. There are no observed webhooks, queues, or scheduled jobs.
Critical Gap: The LivingResume feature is described as "auto-updating," but no mechanism (like a database trigger or scheduled job) exists to perform this update. It currently relies on the user visiting the page to fetch and aggregate data in real-time.
[11. Notifications Matrix]
Notification System: Partially Implemented.
Types:
In-App (Toast): Implemented via useToast() from shadcn/ui.
Triggers:
handleModuleComplete in AdaptiveCapsules: "Module Completed!".
handleSaveSettings in LivingResume: "Settings Saved".
handleSubmit in Community: "Post created successfully!".
Email / Push / SMS: [Not Implemented]. The Settings page contains UI toggles for these notification types, but no backend integration (like SendEmail) is called to deliver them.
[12. Analytics & Telemetry Spec]
Analytics Provider: [Not Implemented]. No integration with GA, Mixpanel, etc.
Internal Analytics Logging: Implemented via the BehaviorEvent entity.
Tracked Events:
page_view: Triggered on mount in Dashboard, CuriosityCompass, Roadmaps, SelfGraph, and AdaptiveCapsules.
Properties: user_email, event_type, page_path.
roadmap_generation_start: Triggered in CuriosityCompass when user clicks "Generate".
Properties: user_email, event_type, metadata: { domains, interests }.
step_complete: Triggered in Roadmaps when a user toggles a step's checkbox.
Properties: user_email, event_type, metadata: { roadmap_id, step_index, completed }.
coach_interaction: Triggered in VirtualCoach when a user sends a message.
Properties: user_email, event_type, metadata: { message }.
[13. Security, Privacy & Compliance]
PII Inventory: The system collects and stores Personally Identifiable Information.
User entity: email, display_name, phone, date_of_birth, bio, education.
BehaviorEvent entity: Tracks user activity linked to user_email.
Consent:
Age Verification / Parental Consent: [Not Implemented]. The UI and data models for this (is_minor, parent_consent in User.json) exist, but the registration flow to enforce it does not. This is a major compliance gap for an app targeting all age groups.
Data Subject Rights (DSR):
Export: [Not Implemented]. The LivingResume page has a "Download PDF" button that triggers the browser's print dialog, which is not a true data export.
Deletion: [Not Implemented]. There is no user-facing feature to request account or data deletion.
Encryption: [Assumption: Base44 platform handles encryption at rest (for the database) and in transit (via HTTPS). No client-side encryption is implemented.
[14. Performance & Reliability]
Pagination: [Not Implemented]. All data fetches (e.g., Project.list(), Mentor.list()) retrieve the entire dataset. This will cause severe performance degradation as the number of records grows.
Caching:
Client-Side: No explicit caching strategy is used. React Query or a similar library is not present.
PWA/Offline: A basic caching mechanism using IndexedDB is implemented in AdaptiveCapsules for offline course viewing, but it's not applied globally.
N+1 Issues: Potential for N+1 problems exists. For example, the /Projects page fetches all submissions and then, in a loop, finds the corresponding project details (projects.find(p => p.id === submission.project_id)). This is inefficient and should be optimized with a backend join or a more efficient data lookup strategy.
[15. Gaps, Assumptions & Recommendations]
Gap 1 (Critical): Incomplete Authentication Flow. The lack of a proper registration, password reset, and age verification flow is the single largest blocker to production readiness.
Recommendation: Create a dedicated /Register page that captures necessary user info, implements the is_minor/parent_consent logic, and integrates with the auth provider. Create a /ForgotPassword page that uses an email service for reset links.
Gap 2 (Critical): Lack of Backend Automation. Features like the "auto-updating" LivingResume and notifications are not automated.
Recommendation: [Assumption: If the platform supports backend functions/triggers], create a trigger on entities like ProjectSubmission and CourseProgress that automatically aggregates data into the User.living_resume JSONB field.
Gap 3 (High): Missing Pagination and Data Filtering. The application is not scalable.
Recommendation: Implement server-side pagination for all list views (Projects, Mentors, Opportunities, Community). Refactor Entity.list() calls to use limits and offsets, and add UI controls (e.g., "Load More" buttons or page number selectors).
Assumption 1: RLS is Enforced. The frontend code is written with the assumption that the backend (Base44 platform) enforces strict Row-Level Security, preventing one user from accessing another's private data even if they craft a malicious API call. This must be verified at the platform level.
Assumption 2: Backend Scalability. The extensive use of InvokeLLM assumes that the backend API has appropriate scaling, rate limiting, and cost management controls in place.
