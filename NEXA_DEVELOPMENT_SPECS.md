### **NEXA ‚Äî FULL-STACK PWA BUILD PROMPT**

**Primary spec used**: üåü Nexa ‚Äî Your Dream, Reimagined.docx

Below is a single, complete, paste-ready prompt you can drop into Bolt.new, Lovable.dev, Cursor, Claude, Bubble.io, Replit, Base44 AI, or other AI coding platforms to produce a production-grade Progressive Web App (PWA) for Nexa. It contains the role/goal framing, exhaustive functional and non-functional requirements, data models, API surface, algorithms and ML design, frontend & backend architecture, infra & deployment, testing, monitoring, privacy/compliance, accessibility, offline + low-bandwidth considerations, and explicit deliverables. Do not cut or edit unless you want to change tech-stack choices ‚Äî paste the whole block.

---

**BEGIN PROMPT** (paste everything below into the AI coding platform)

You are a Senior Full-Stack Product Delivery Engine and Technical Co-founder AI.

**Role method** ‚Äî Let's play a very interesting game: from now on you will play the role Lead Engineer & Product Team (Full-stack PWA Builder), a new generation AI engineer that can design, implement, test, document, and deploy a production Progressive Web App with frontend, backend, algorithms, databases, infra, and CI/CD. To do that, you will produce fully working code, infra as code, tests, deployment scripts, monitoring, and a developer & product README. If a human engineer has knowledge level 10, you have knowledge level 280 in full-stack product delivery. Be careful: quality must be production grade ‚Äî mistakes cost user trust and real users. Deliver complete, secure, documented, maintainable, tested, and deployable code and artifacts.

**Knowledge method** ‚Äî You have deep knowledge of PWA standards (service workers, web manifest, caching strategies), modern frontend frameworks (React/Next.js or SvelteKit), server frameworks (Node.js/Express, NestJS, or FastAPI), databases (Postgres, Redis, Vector DB), vector search & RAG, realtime (WebSocket/Firebase/Supabase), authentication, privacy & minors best practices, low-bandwidth UX, and deployment (Vercel, Render, Railway, AWS/GCP).

**Emotion method** ‚Äî If you deliver incomplete, insecure, or poorly documented work, students and mentors will be let down, platform adoption will fail in Tier 3 & 4 markets, and early funding and trust will evaporate ‚Äî so prioritize reliability, privacy, and low-bandwidth UX.

**Project Goal** (single-sentence)

Build Nexa ‚Äî a production Progressive Web App (PWA) that guides learners (age 13+) through curiosity‚Üíroadmap‚Üískills‚Üíprojects‚Üíplacement; includes SelfGraph identity intelligence, AI Career Therapist, AI Roadmaps, Mentor Matchmaking, Living Resume, Project Playground, and domain-specific demand/supply matching ‚Äî complete with frontend, backend, algorithms, DB connectivity, admin portals, recruiter flows, CI/CD, monitoring, and documentation.

**High-Priority Requirements** (expanded ‚Äî ‚â•150 words)

You will implement an offline-first, low-bandwidth PWA optimized for mobile devices and poor networks (Tier-3/4 India) that provides gamified exploration (Curiosity Compass), AI-generated evolving roadmaps, incremental micro-learning capsules, live portfolio (Living Resume), industry project playground, and AI-driven mentor and job matching using a hybrid rule + ML ranking system. Behavior must be captured passively (clicks, session times, content views) and combined with explicit inputs (goals, projects, reflections) to drive continuous SelfGraph updates. Include a chat-based Virtual Career Coach and an AI Career Therapist that monitors emotional signals and escalates to human mentors when needed. Provide a domain specific demand/supply grid where companies post opportunities into domain pools and users are matched by skills + portfolio + behavioral fit. The system must support minors (age gating, parental consent flows), multilingual UI, accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA), and strong privacy controls (data deletion, export). Deliver frontend, backend, API docs (OpenAPI/GraphQL schema), database migrations/seeds, tests (unit/integration/E2E), infra code, and a reproducible CI/CD pipeline.

**Must-deliver artifacts**

- Monorepo (or linked repos) with frontend/, backend/, infrastructure/, docs/, tests/.
- Production PWA (service worker, manifest, offline caching, push notifications).
- Backend API (REST or GraphQL) with auth, RBAC, and webhooks.
- Database schema & migrations (SQL for Postgres) + seeders.
- Vector DB + embeddings pipeline for content & profile matching.
- Recommendation & matching ML code (training + inference + online ranking).
- Admin & recruiter dashboards.
- CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions) and deployment scripts (Terraform or simple infra for Render/Vercel).
- Comprehensive README, architecture diagram, API docs (Swagger/GraphQL), and runbook.
- Tests: unit, integration, E2E (Playwright/Cypress), and load test artifacts (k6).

**Matching & Recommendation Algorithm** (design)

**Objective**: Hybrid matching algorithm that balances explicit skills, project evidence (Living Resume), behavior-based affinity, domain demand, and mentorship fit.

**Components**

1. **Feature engineering** (server side)
   - Profile skill vector (one-hot + weight by recency).
   - Project evidence score (validated projects count, ratings).
   - Behavior signals: average session time per domain, click frequency, energy zone.
   - Decision alignment score: how often user completes steps recommended.
   - Mentor compatibility features: timezone, language, availability.

2. **Embedding layer**
   - Convert content, project descriptions, and profile summaries to vectors (OpenAI/alternative).
   - Store vectors in Vector DB.

3. **Candidate retrieval**
   - Use vector similarity to fetch top-K for domain and project matches.
   - Filter by hard constraints (location, eligibility).

4. **Scoring**
   - Weighted linear combination:
     ```
     score = w1 * skill_overlap + w2 * embedding_similarity + w3 * project_evidence + w4 * behavior_alignment + w5 * recruiter_priority
     ```
   - Learn weights using supervised ranking (pairwise ranking / LambdaMART) on click/engagement/hire signals.

5. **Online learning loop**
   - Collect feedback (applied, interviewed, accepted).
   - Retrain ranking models periodically; allow online small updates to weights.

**AI Career Therapist**

Lightweight sentiment and intent detector on user text & behavior; triggers suggestions or human escalation.

Rules for escalation: repeated negative sentiment + drop in activity + failed attempts ‚Üí surface mentor help.

**Explainability**

For each match, produce human-readable reasons: e.g., "Matched because: skill X, project Y rating, recent interest in topic Z (viewed 5 articles last week)."

**SelfGraph & Living Resume design**

SelfGraph = time series of attributes (strengths, values, confidence, energy) updated on each behavior event + explicit reflections.

Represent as JSON with versioned snapshots.

Visualize as radar / timeline in frontend.

Keep living resume as a normalized JSON export that maps to a recruiter readable PDF and structured Talent Passport (Verifiable Credentials optional).

**Frontend: Pages & Components** (recommended)

1. Auth / Onboarding (age gating + parental consent)
2. Curiosity Compass (swipe / card game)
3. Dashboard (SelfGraph snapshot, nudges)
4. Roadmap viewer & editor
5. SkillStacker (skill gaps)
6. Capsules (micro-learning feed)
7. Project Playground (create/join projects, submit)
8. Mentor directory & booking
9. Virtual Career Coach chat UI (LLM + context)
10. Living Resume editor & export
11. Opportunities feed & application
12. Admin console & recruiter portal

- Worker processes:
  - Embedding worker (enqueue content -> embed -> write vector DB)
  - Recommendation worker (recompute candidate rankings)
  - Notification worker (FCM, Push API)
  - ML service (model hosting or connecting to external LLM + local ranking model)
- Storage: Postgres (primary), S3 (files), Vector DB (similarity), Redis (cache & rate limits)
- Realtime: Supabase/Firebase or WebSocket cluster for chat and mentor presence.

**Integrations**

- Implement rate limiting & abuse detection on behavior ingestion.
- Age gating & parental consent flows; data deletion and export per user request.
- Privacy dashboard: allow users to view and toggle tracking & sharing preferences.
- Data retention policy: default retention of behavior data configurable; anonymize after X months.
- Store production secrets in vault (HashiCorp / cloud secret manager).

**Accessibility & Localization**

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance: keyboard nav, screen reader labels, contrast, adjustable font.
- Provide UI translations (i18n) ‚Äî start with English + Hindi + one regional language; implement translation keys.
- Simple vocabulary mode for low literacy users; iconography heavy UI.

**Testing & QA**

- Unit tests for frontend (Jest/RTL) & backend (Jest / pytest).
- Integration tests for API endpoints.
- E2E tests (Playwright or Cypress) covering onboarding, roadmap generation, project submission, and job application flow.
- Load tests with k6: simulate concurrent users ingesting behavior events and matchmaking.
- Security tests: static analysis and dependency scanning (Snyk), run OWASP ZAP scan in CI.

**CI/CD & Deploy**

- GitHub Actions workflows:
  - PR checks: lint, unit tests, build.
  - Main branch: build + deploy to staging.
  - Release: promote to production with migrations, DB backups.
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) for production; small deployments can use Render/Vercel + managed Postgres for MVP.
- Automated DB migrations using Flyway/TypeORM/Prisma Migrate.
- Canary deployments for backend ML service.

**Monitoring & Observability**

- Error tracking: Sentry.
- Metrics: Prometheus + Grafana dashboards for request latency, queue depth, ML inference times.

- Admin dashboard to:
  - Seed demo data and moderate content
  - Monitor unusual behavior/signals
  - Escalate AI therapist cases
  - Manage domain taxonomies and mentor verification

**Prioritized MVP Scope** (must ship)

1. Onboarding + age gating + living resume basic
2. Curiosity Compass + behavior capture and SelfGraph snapshot
3. AI Roadmap generator (RAG-based simple)
4. Project Playground basics (create, submit, review)
5. Mentor directory + request scheduling (no video in MVP)
6. Opportunity posting + basic matching (vector retrieval + simple scoring)
7. PWA offline caching + local event queue + sync
8. Admin console w/ user moderation

(Everything else is "v1+" scope.)

**Acceptance Criteria / Example Test Cases**

- New user signs up (age <16): parental consent workflow created; no access to mentor chat until consent granted.
- Behavior events queued offline while device offline; syncs and appears in analytics when back online.
- Roadmap generation returns a structured JSON of steps with resources and estimated times.
- SkillStacker shows at least 3 recommended micro-courses per identified gap.
- Mentor matchmaking returns at least 5 ranked mentors for a sample domain, with human-readable reasons.

**Deliverable Checklist** (what the AI must output)

- Repo skeleton with frontend/backend/infrastructure + scripts to run locally (docker-compose for dev).
- Dockerfiles and dev container support.
- OpenAPI/GraphQL schema file.
- Postgres migrations & seed data.
- Example env file and guardian/consent test accounts.
- README with architecture diagram, setup, and deploy steps.
- Postman collection / GraphQL queries.
- E2E test suite and instructions to run load tests.

**Developer notes & implementation guidance**

- Use feature flags for ML features; default to safe heuristics if LLM not available.
- Design the SelfGraph as an append-only event log with periodic densification (batch job) into a snapshot table for fast reads.
- For low-cost MVP hosting: use Vercel for frontend + Railway or Render for backend + Supabase Postgres to speed dev.
- Always store user consent & privacy flags as first-class fields.
- Keep vector DB usage cost-efficient by limiting embedding frequency (e.g., embed new content + major profile updates, not every click).

**Tone & Developer Instructions** (how the AI should write code & docs)

- Code style: idiomatic TypeScript (strict mode) for frontend & backend. Use ESLint + Prettier.
- Documentation: concise + example first. Provide code comments for non-trivial algorithms.
- UX writing: supportive, non-judgemental, encouraging tone for career therapist messaging.
- Tests: exhaustive for business logic; higher coverage on ranking, matching, and privacy handling.

**Tips for Implementation**

- Start with a small domain taxonomy (4 domains) and mock data to validate the matching pipeline.
- Use server-side rendering for initial pages for SEO & first paint performance.
- Batch behavior events on the client and flush every N seconds or on visibilitychange to minimize network overhead.
- Implement soft-delete and data retention toggles early.

**How to run this prompt in different platforms**

1. Paste entire block into the platform prompt field.
2. Ask the platform to produce a Git repository with frontend/ + backend/ + infra/ and run scripts to bootstrap dev environment.
3. Request the platform to produce incremental PRs for each major artifact (e.g., PR1: repo skeleton, PR2: auth & onboarding, PR3: Curiosity Compass, PR4: Roadmap generator, etc.) ‚Äî but if the platform cannot do PRs, request a zipped repo.

*Below is the complete product brief that serves as the foundation for all development work. This document contains the vision, problem statement, user journey, and detailed feature breakdown.*

### **üåü NEXA ‚Äî YOUR DREAM, REIMAGINED**

**Job Career Edition**

#### **üö® The Problem**

Every student has faced it:

- They finish school or college confused, lost, and unclear ‚Äî making career choices based on pressure, hearsay, or sheer lack of exposure.
- They're expected to "figure it out" after the degree. But by then, it's already too late.
- Or worse, you're 3‚Äì5 years into a job and realize: This isn't what I want.
- Career choices are made by chance, not choice.
- The system offers generic aptitude tests, outdated advice, and zero real-world exploration.
- Career transitions feel risky, lonely, and unsupported ‚Äî especially in Tier 3, 4 & rural India, where many don't even know they're stuck in a problem until it's too late.

Today's career counseling is outdated, expensive, judgmental, and painfully linear. A couple of generic aptitude tests or a one-time expert session cannot define an entire life.

Gen Z and Gen Alpha demand more ‚Äî freedom to explore, room to fail, power to choose, and a system that evolves with them.

And while Tier 1 & Tier 2 cities are beginning to speak about this... In Tier 3, Tier 4, and rural India, the silence is deafening. These students don't even realize they're facing this problem ‚Äî because no one's ever asked them.

- No one asked about their dreams.
- No one showed them what's possible.
- They're told what to become ‚Äî not guided toward what they would love to be.

**The result?**
- Career planning & career transitioning starts too late
- Generic tests decide your future like roulette
- No exposure, no roadmap, no clarity
- Just noise, pressure, and regret
- No exposure. No roadmap. No second chance.
- Most people don't choose their careers ‚Äî they stumble into them.

#### **üåà The Vision**

To build a guided, tech-first, emotionally intelligent ecosystem that guides students from age 13 to their first job, and even after that, if the path needs a pivot ‚Äî with clarity, confidence, and creativity.

> "We're not here to decide for you. We're here to help you design your own path. We help you build a life you'll actually want to live."

**What if we didn't wait until the end?**
- What if we started at 14, not 24?
- What if a student could:
  - Discover who they are ‚Äî not just their marks
  - Explore real-world domains, not vague labels
  - Make informed decisions, not panic picks
  - Build a living resume ‚Äî from class 8 onwards
  - Connect with real people, real projects, real futures

And what if it all happened in one ecosystem ‚Äî made for short attention spans, deep identity discovery, and real growth?

#### **üöÄ The Product: Nexa**

#### **üß† Core Philosophy**

> "Don't wait for students to reach the battlefield. Train them from childhood to master their weapons, understand their purpose, and love the fight ‚Äî and when needed, make changing the battlefield as graceful and powerful as entering it the first time."

#### **üåç The Mission**

To ensure that every student ‚Äî from Tier 1 cities to remote villages ‚Äî gets a fair shot at discovering who they are and becoming who they're meant to be.

To make sure no student is ever left alone to figure out their future at the very end. Not in class 12. Not after a wrong degree.

We start before the confusion begins ‚Äî and walk with them till clarity becomes action.

### **üöÄ Startup, Business, Entrepreneurship Edition**

#### **üö® The Problem (Entrepreneurship Edition)**

Most people in Tier 3, 4, and rural India (and even many in urban India) don't grow up knowing that entrepreneurship is a real option. Most people don't grow up hearing the word "startup." They hear "job," "government exam," or "do what your uncle did."

- Startups? Founders? Business models? These are alien words ‚Äî associated with rich, tech-savvy, urban elites, not "ordinary students."
- In Tier 3, Tier 4, and rural India ‚Äî entrepreneurship is seen as risky, elite, or just confusing.
- No one teaches you how to build your own thing ‚Äî not in school, not in college. You're told to become something ‚Äî never to create something.
- Yet, some of the world's most powerful solutions can emerge from local problems ‚Äî if people are empowered to solve them.

But the system never shows them how.

Gen Z and Gen Alpha aren't just job seekers. They're idea-seekers, freedom-lovers, and impact-hunters. They want to solve problems, build things, and write their own playbook ‚Äî but have no clue where to start.

**Today's system doesn't offer that journey:**
- Entrepreneurship is glamorized for Shark Tank, not demystified for grassroots.
- "Business" is seen as risky, unstructured, or reserved for those with money or family legacy.
- No platform systematically teaches students to think like builders, problem-solvers, and value creators ‚Äî from school level itself.
- Even when someone has an idea, they don't know how to test, build, or validate it ‚Äî especially without capital, team, or tech skills.
- There's no guided system to incubate entrepreneurial identity as it forms ‚Äî especially outside Tier 1 circles.

So students grow up consuming products, not creating them. And many natural founders die inside jobs they were never meant to do.

#### **üåà The Vision (Entrepreneurship Edition)**

To build a creator-first ecosystem that plants the seed of entrepreneurship early, nurtures the startup mindset with exposure, helps build real-world projects, connects budding founders to a peer creator community, and walks with them from idea to venture ‚Äî whether they want to build a company, join one, or simply think like a founder.

To rebuild how India discovers and develops entrepreneurs. Not through jargon, but through exposure, curiosity, real projects, and hands-on experience ‚Äî from school to postgrad.

We won't ask students to "start a company." We'll guide them to think like creators, solve real problems, test ideas, and build meaningful value.

**What if:**
- Students learned about the startup world in Class 8?
- Side projects and curiosity could evolve into companies?
- Tier 3 kids had access to the same startup literacy as IIT grads?
- Anyone could become a builder ‚Äî no matter their English, city, or marks?

Nexa will guide them with:
- Behavioral signals
- Emotional safety
- Domain-specific pathways
- Startup mentors & founders
- No-pressure experiments
- Real-world launch pads

> "You don't need money or MBA jargon to be a founder. You need curiosity, clarity, courage ‚Äî and a support system that believes in you before the world does."

> "Don't just chase jobs. Learn how to create them ‚Äî for yourself and for others."

#### **üöÄ The Product: Nexa (Entrepreneurship Edition)**

A Progressive Web App that becomes your personal venture co-pilot ‚Äî planting the seed of entrepreneurship early, growing your builder mindset through projects and community, and guiding you from your first idea to your first launch.

A powerful, evolving platform designed for:
- Students from Class 8 to College
- Professionals exploring entrepreneurship for the first time
- Curious minds in Tier 3, 4, and rural India who've never been introduced to the startup world

Whether you're just discovering what a startup is, building your first idea, or transitioning into your founder era ‚Äî Nexa evolves with you with:
- Deep personalization
- Community-based startup literacy
- Real-world builder tools
- Emotional safety, encouragement, and clarity

It's not a startup course. Not a one-time bootcamp. It's a living, breathing venture journey ‚Äî made for those who never thought they could be builders. And especially for those who've always wanted to be.

#### **üîÅ The Nexa Loop**

**üí≠ Discover ‚Üí üîß Build ‚Üí üåê Connect ‚Üí üîÅ Evolve**

The journey doesn't end ‚Äî it adapts as you grow.

### **üìå TL;DR**

Nexa isn't just a platform. Nexa is the world's first full-spectrum career platform for:
- Students from class 8 to college
- Professionals wanting to transition meaningfully
- People who want clarity, not confusion

It's a lifelong companion that helps you discover what you love, who you are, and how to become that ‚Äî before the world tells you what you "should" be.

---

### **NEXA ‚Äî COMPLETE, EXHAUSTIVE PRODUCT PROMPT (BUILD-READY)**

**Primary source**: use the uploaded product brief "üåü Nexa ‚Äî Your Dream Career, Reimagined.docx" as the canonical spec.

Below is a single, comprehensive, build-ready product prompt describing every user journey, feature start/finish, UI layout, frontend behavior (offline + automation), backend services, DB schema, algorithms, integrations, security/compliance, testing, observability, deploy & cost notes, edge cases, and deliverables. Paste it into an engineering / AI generation platform (Bolt.new, Cursor, Lovables, Claude, Replit, etc.) to generate code, workflows, infra, docs, and tests.

**NOTE**: this is intentionally exhaustive. If the target platform can't produce everything at once, request incremental PRs following the prioritized feature list below.

#### **Scope & Objectives**

Build Nexa, a Progressive Web App (PWA) that becomes a lifelong career co-pilot for learners (13+) and career-transitioners.

Deliver frontend (PWA) + backend APIs & workers + DB schema + ML pipelines + integrations + CI/CD + tests + docs.

UX must be mobile-first, offline-first, multilingual, accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA) and low-bandwidth optimized (Tier-3/4 focus).

**Key principle**: Discover ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Connect ‚Üí Evolve (the Nexa Loop).

#### **High-Level User Journeys (Explicit Start ‚Üí End, Triggers, Automations)**

**3. Curiosity Compass**

- **Entry**: Dashboard ‚Üí Compass CTA or onboarding
- **UI**: swipe deck (cards with domain title, one-liner, tags); fallback list view for low-memory devices.
- **Events**: each swipe creates {event_type: "swipe", card_id, response, confidence, timestamp}. Stored in local_event_queue and batched to /api/events (behavior pipeline).
- **Backend effects**: behavior events appended to event stream ‚Üí consumed by selfgraph_updater worker that updates evolving SelfGraph snapshot (densified periodically).
- **Trigger automations**: if a domain receives 3+ "strong interest" swipes in X days ‚Üí auto-open "Start Roadmap" modal. If user abandons compass 3 sessions in a row ‚Üí coach nudges to re-engage.
- **Exit**: after N swipes or manual close: user returns to Dashboard or Roadmap generator run.

**4. AI-Powered Roadmaps**

- **Entry**: from Compass hint, Dashboard CTA, or explicit "Generate Roadmap" button.
- **UI**: Timeline + Stepper + Kanban view (To Do, In Progress, Done) with inline edits. Each step has title, time_est, resources, difficulty, prereqs, evidence_type.
- **Automation lifecycle**:
  - **Generate**: POST /api/roadmaps/generate {user_id, seed_domains, constraints} triggers roadmap_generator worker (RAG). Worker: fetch user snapshot + domain taxonomy + curated resource corpus ‚Üí retrieve top-k ‚Üí LLM fuse into ordered steps. Store roadmap JSON and step embeddings in DB.
  - **Start Step**: client PATCH /api/roadmaps/:rid/steps/:sid {status:"in_progress", started_at} ‚Üí optimistic UI. Worker acknowledges and creates task_timer if user opts.
  - **Complete Step**: PATCH status:"done", create resume_entry if flagged, award badges, push behavior event. If step had project, create project_draft skeleton.
  - **Auto-replan**: periodic job recalculates roadmap priorities using recent event decay model (recent events more weight).
- **Completion**: roadmap status=completed when all mandatory steps done; archived version stored.

**5. SkillStacker (Gap Analysis)**

- **Entry**: Roadmap page ‚Üí "Analyze skills" or dedicated SkillStacker view
- **UI**: side-by-side bars: Current vs Required, detailed suggestions list of capsules/projects.
- **Algorithm**:
  - Compose skill_vector_user (skills + proficiency + recency_decay).
  - Compose skill_vector_domain (required by roadmap or job).
  - gap = domain ‚àí user ‚Üí sort by magnitude. For each gap select capsules/projects scored by score = Œ± * content_similarity + Œ≤ * estimated_time_fit + Œ≥ * popularity + Œ¥ * recency.
- **Automation**: "Add to Roadmap" appends capsule/project as a step. Auto-schedule reminders and instantiate short accountability tasks.

**6. Adaptive Capsules**

- **Entry**: Capsules feed or inserted step in roadmap/skillstacker
- **UI**: card list with title, estimated time, source, saving/downloading toggles. Allow "Text only" preview for low bandwidth.

  - **Showcase**: high-scoring projects auto-suggested in Opportunities feed.
- **Completion**: project archived with outcomes and added to Living Resume as project_entry.

**8. Living Resume**

- **Entry**: auto-update from projects/roadmap/capsules or manual edits
- **UI**: editable sections (summary, skills, projects, achievements), preview (public/private), export buttons (PDF / link / Talent Passport JSON).
- **Automation**: event-driven: workers transform behavior_events and resume_entries into structured resume object. Auto-suggestions appear in UI; user approves before public exposure. Export uses headless rendering (Puppeteer) and signed shareable URLs.
- **Privacy**: visibility controls; audit log for changes; export records.

**9. Mentor Matchmaking & Sessions**

- **Entry**: Mentor page, Roadmap suggestion, Coach escalation
- **UI**: mentor cards (bio, domains, languages, rating, availability, "Why match" explanation).
- **Matching pipeline**:
  - **Candidate retrieval**: vector similarity (profile embedding ‚Üî mentor embedding).

  - **Explainability**: return top reasons for match (e.g., "Completed similar project X, interested in robotics, prefers mentor language Hindi").
- **Workflows**: book via calendar integration (Google Calendar/Jitsi/Twilio). On completion, feedback updates mentor rating and user's trust score.

**10. Virtual Career Coach & AI Career Therapist**

- **Entry**: Dashboard chat, coach notifications, or therapist escalation
- **UI**: chat window with context cards (current roadmap, mood, recent projects). Emotion detection overlays and recommended actions.
- **Engine & rules**:
  - **Coach (LLM + tools)**: LLM receives user message + context window (SelfGraph snapshot, recent events, roadmap). Provide suggestive actions (micro-tasks, capsules, mentor matches). Use system prompt templates (see below).
  - **Therapist (classifier + LLM)**: sentiment classifier (fine-tuned BERT) flags sustained negative sentiment or dropout signals. Rules:
    - If negative_sentiment_count ‚â• 3 in 14 days AND activity_drop > 40% ‚Üí show supportive content + suggest mentor.
    - If severe risk keywords ‚Üí show crisis resources & flag admin/moderator.
- **Safety**: never provide clinical advice; escalate to human mentor/moderator as appropriate. Chat drafts saved locally and synced.

**11. Opportunities (Jobs/Internships) & Domain Demand-Supply**

- **Entry**: Opportunity feed, recruiter dashboard, job-match notifications
- **UI**: job cards with match_strength and explanation, recruiter tools for posting/shortlisting.
- **Pipeline**: recruiter posts ‚Üí vectorize job desc ‚Üí nightly match job ‚Üî candidate embeddings ‚Üí rank by score = Œ± * skill_overlap + Œ≤*project_evidence + Œ≥*behavioral_fit + Œ¥*profile_completeness + Œµ*recruiter_priority. Present top-K with reasons. Recruiter can short-list and invite.
- **Automation**: tracked signals: applied ‚Üí interviewed ‚Üí hired feed back to reweight ranking. Also support domain pools (talent pools per domain) for curated hiring.

**12. Admin & Recruiter Console**

- **Functions**: seed demo data, moderate content, review flagged events, manage taxonomy, view metrics, export candidates. Admin workflows control content taxonomy, domain mappings, moderation flows, and escalations from AI therapist.

**Key Frontend Patterns**

- **Offline queue (IndexedDB)**: structured store events, drafts, attachments. Background sync worker flushes on navigator.onLine or visibility change. Limit daily upload size; drop oldest local caches after threshold.
- **Data fetching**: React Query with stale-while-revalidate; critical endpoints pre-fetched on login.
- **Optimistic UI**: roadmap step toggles, capsule completion, project joins. Undo UX for destructive ops.
- **Accessibility**: semantic elements, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, color contrast tokens.
- **Low-bandwidth UX**: text-first views, LQIP images, defer video, allow "lite mode" toggles.

#### **Backend Architecture & Services (Detailed)**

**Microservices & Responsibilities**

- **API Gateway** (routing, auth, rate limit)
- **Auth Service** (JWT, OTP, OAuth, parental consent enforcement)
- **User Profile Service** (CRUD, preferences)
- **Event Ingest Service** (accepts events/batches ‚Üí writes to Kafka/Redis Stream + Postgres)
- **SelfGraph Updater Worker** (consumes event stream ‚Üí feature extraction ‚Üí update snapshots)
- **Embeddings Worker** (call embedding provider ‚Üí store in vector DB)
- **Roadmap Generator Service (RAG)** (retrieval from vector DB + LLM orchestration)
- **Matchmaker Service** (job/mentor matching pipelines + retraining hooks)
- **Project Service** (projects CRUD, uploads, review scoring)
- **Resume Service** (compose/approve/export)
- **Notification Service** (push, email, SMS via providers)
- **ML Service** (training & model serving for ranking, sentiment)
- **Admin & Analytics Services** (metrics, dashboards)

**Inter-service comms**: Kafka (event-driven) + gRPC/REST for synchronous APIs.

#### **Database Schema (Expanded, with Indexes & Purpose)**

Provide Postgres tables (DDL snippets), plus vector DB usage.

**Core Tables (Abridged)**

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  email text UNIQUE,
  phone text UNIQUE,
  display_name text,
  dob date,
  is_minor boolean DEFAULT false,
  parent_consent boolean DEFAULT false,
  language text,
  role text,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
CREATE INDEX ON users (email);

CREATE TABLE behavior_events (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid REFERENCES users(id),
  event_type text,
  payload jsonb,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
CREATE INDEX ON behavior_events (user_id, created_at);

CREATE TABLE selfgraph_snapshots (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid REFERENCES users(id),
  snapshot jsonb,
  version int,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

CREATE TABLE roadmaps (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid REFERENCES users(id),
  domain text,
  title text,
  steps jsonb,
  status text,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamptz
);
CREATE INDEX ON roadmaps (user_id);

CREATE TABLE projects ( ... ) ;
CREATE TABLE resume_entries ( ... );
CREATE TABLE mentors ( ... );
CREATE TABLE opportunities ( ... );

-- Embeddings stored in vector DB; keep metadata ref in Postgres
CREATE TABLE embeddings_meta (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  ref_type text,
  ref_id uuid,
  provider text,
  vector_id text,
  metadata jsonb,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
```

**Vector DB (Pinecone/Weaviate/Milvus)** holds high-dimensional vectors for:
- content resources
- user profile snapshots
- project descriptions
- job descriptions
- mentor profiles

#### **Algorithms & ML (Detailed Design)**

**Embeddings Pipeline**

- **Trigger**: new content / major profile update / new project / job posting
- **Process**: normalize text ‚Üí call embedding provider ‚Üí store vector in Vector DB and metadata in Postgres embeddings_meta.
- **Cost controls**: only embed major changes; sample minor clicks aggregated into daily digest.

**Roadmap Generator (RAG)**

- **Retrieval**: query vector DB for top-K resources relevant to user's SelfGraph & seed domain.
- **Prompt template (example)**:
  ```
  SYSTEM: You are Nexa Roadmap Builder. Compose an ordered roadmap for a learner with constraints below.
  USER: {user_snapshot_json}
  CONSTRAINTS: {max_steps}, {max_time_per_step_minutes}, {offline_preference}, {language}
  RESOURCES: {list of top_k resource metadata}
  INSTRUCTIONS: produce JSON: [{step_id, title, description, estimated_time_min, resources:[ids], difficulty, evidence_type}]
  ```
- **Safety**: instruct LLM to avoid paid-only resources if user set 'no paid content'.

**Matching & Ranking**

- **Two-stage**: retrieval (vector), re-rank (feature-based).
- **Feature vector includes**: skill_overlap, project_evidence_score, recency_weighted_interest, mentor/role language/timezone, profile completeness.
- **Scoring formula (example)**:
  ```
  score = 0.35*skill_overlap + 0.25*embedding_similarity + 0.15*project_score + 0.10*behavior_alignment + 0.10*profile_completeness + 0.05*recruiter_priority
  ```
- **Learning to rank**: collect training data (applied‚Üíinterview‚Üíoffer) and train LambdaMART / XGBoost pairwise ranking; update re-ranker weekly.

**SelfGraph Updates**

- **Event extraction**: events ‚Üí feature extraction (e.g., time_on_topic, completion_rates, streaks) ‚Üí append to event log.
- **Densification**: nightly batch compute snapshot: vectorized summary + semantic summary for UI. Keep versions for timeline.

**Therapist & Sentiment**

- **Classifier**: fine-tuned BERT for sentiment & intent; thresholded rules for escalations.
- **Privacy**: never share sensitive content outside secure channels; escalate only on consented paths.

#### **API Design (Key Endpoints + Sample Payloads)**

**Auth**
- POST /api/auth/signup
  - payload {email, phone, name, dob, method} ‚Üí returns {user, token}

**Events**
- POST /api/events/batch
  - payload {user_id, events: [{type, payload, timestamp}] } ‚Üí ack {ingested: true, batch_id}

**Roadmaps**
- POST /api/roadmaps/generate ‚Üí {user_id, domains, constraints} returns {roadmap_id, status}

**Match**
- POST /api/match/opportunities ‚Üí returns ranked list with reasons.

**Resume Export**
- GET /api/resume/:user_id/export?format=pdf ‚Üí returns signed URL.

**(Full OpenAPI required in deliverables.)**

#### **Integrations & Third-Party Services**

- **Embeddings & LLMs**: OpenAI/Cohere/Anthropic or open self-hosted models.
- **Vector DB**: Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus.
- **Storage**: AWS S3 / Supabase Storage.
- **Auth & OTP**: Auth0/Twilio.
- **Push & Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging / OneSignal.
- **Video/Calls**: Jitsi / Twilio Video.
- **Payments (if mentor payments)**: Stripe + UPI gateway for India.
- **Email**: SendGrid / SES.
- **Analytics**: Snowplow/Segment for event warehousing; Matomo for privacy-first analytics.

#### **Security, Privacy & Compliance**

- **Encryption**: TLS in transit, AES-256 at rest.
- **Auth**: OAuth + JWT + refresh token rotation.
- **Secrets**: Vault (HashiCorp / cloud secret manager).
- **Minor protection**: parental consent flow‚Äîblocked features until consent; store consent logs and timestamps.
- **Data subject rights**: endpoints for data export and deletion (GDPR / India PDP).
- **Abuse detection**: rate limits, anomaly detection on event ingestion.

#### **Offline-First & Caching Strategies (Practical)**

**Service Worker (Workbox)**:
- **Static shell**: cache-first (v2 shell).
- **API calls**: stale-while-revalidate for /api/users/:id/summary; network-first for critical writes queued.

**IndexedDB schema**: stores events, drafts, resume_drafts, capsule_cache.

**Sync algorithm (pseudocode)**:
```
onConnectivityChange(true):
  for batch in readBatches('events'):
    try POST /api/events/batch
    if success: deleteBatch
```

**Conflict resolution**: server authoritative; if patch conflict, client shows merge UI.

#### **Observability, Testing & QA**

- **Logging**: structured JSON logs to ELK.
- **Errors**: Sentry.
- **Metrics**: Prometheus + Grafana (request latency, queue depth, ML inference times, DAU/WAU/MAU, conversion funnel).
- **Tests**: unit (Jest), integration (Supertest), E2E (Playwright), accessibility (axe), performance (Lighthouse + k6).
- **SLA targets**: cached endpoints <200ms; warm ML inference <200ms; cold <1s.

#### **Deployment & Cost-Optimization**

- **MVP hosting**: Vercel (frontend), Render/Railway (backend), Supabase Postgres, Pinecone starter.
- **Infra as Code**: Terraform modules for prod.
- **Cost tips**: limit embedding frequency, tiered vector DB retention, serverless ML for inference, use caching & CDN aggressively.

#### **Edge Cases & Error Handling**

- **Age falsification**: require aadhar/ID verification optional for high-trust features.
- **Parental consent revoked**: mark is_minor=true & lock features; notify user & parent.
- **Offline huge attachments**: block large uploads offline; allow URL attachments only.
- **Duplicate events**: de-duplicate by event UUID.

#### **Acceptance Criteria & Deliverables**

**MVP Acceptance (Examples)**:
- Signup + age gate flows functioning with consent enforcement.
- Curiosity Compass swipe events reliably queued offline and synced.
- Roadmap generation returns structured JSON with steps & resources.
- Project creation + submission + review updates Living Resume.
- Mentor matchmaking returns explainable matches.
- Chat coach responds, therapist escalates per rules.
- PDF resume export works and respect visibility settings.
- Admin tools for moderation + domain pools + shortlisting.

**Deliverables**:
- Monorepo with frontend/, backend/, ml/, infra/, docs/, tests/.
- OpenAPI spec, DB migrations & seeders, vector DB schema, LLM prompt templates, CI pipelines (GitHub Actions), k6 load tests, architecture diagrams, runbook, monitoring dashboards.

#### **Operational KPIs & Experiments**

- **Activation**: % users completing onboarding & 5+ Compass swipes.
- **Retention**: 7/30-day retention.
- **Engagement**: avg capsules completed/day.
- **Progress**: % users with 1 project in 3 months.
- **Conversion (hiring)**: application‚Üíinterview‚Üíhire rates.
- **Safety**: % therapy escalations resolved by mentors within SLA.

#### **Next Steps (How AI Builder Should Proceed)**

- **PR-1**: Repo skeleton + auth + onboarding + offline queue.
- **PR-2**: Compass + events ingestion + selfgraph updater (mock).
- **PR-3**: Roadmap generator (RAG pipeline mock) + roadmap UI.
- **PR-4**: Capsules + project playground + resume flow.
- **PR-5**: Mentors + matchmaking + chat coach + therapist safeguards.
- **PR-6**: Opportunities + recruiter portal + admin console.
- **PR-7**: ML training pipeline, ranking & retraining.
- **PR-8**: Full infra, monitoring, tests, and docs.

**This prompt must be executed end-to-end. If anything is underspecified, the builder should choose pragmatic, production-grade defaults and document all decisions. Use the uploaded Nexa brief as the product source of truth.**
