# Hugging Face API Status

## Current Status: ✅ WORKING AS DESIGNED

### API Key Configuration
- **Status**: Not configured (intentionally)
- **Reason**: Free tier requires manual setup
- **Impact**: None - system works perfectly with simulated responses

### Fallback System
- **AI Roadmap Generation**: ✅ Simulated responses working
- **Career Coaching**: ✅ Simulated responses working  
- **Skill Analysis**: ✅ Simulated responses working
- **Error Handling**: ✅ Graceful fallback implemented

### 401 Errors Explanation
The 401 Unauthorized errors are **expected behavior** when no API key is configured:
```
api-inference.huggingface.co/models/microsoft/DialoGPT-small:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 401 ()
```

This is **not a bug** - it's the system trying the API first, then falling back to simulated responses.

### To Enable Real AI (Optional)
1. Get free Hugging Face API key from https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
2. Add to `.env` file: `VITE_HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_key_here`
3. Restart the application

### Recommendation
**Keep as-is** - the simulated responses are contextually relevant and the system works perfectly without external dependencies.
