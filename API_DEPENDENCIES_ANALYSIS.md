# API Dependencies Analysis

## Current External API Requirements

### 1. **Hugging Face API** (Optional - Free Tier Available)
- **Purpose**: AI-powered responses for career coaching, roadmap generation, skill analysis
- **Current Status**: 401 Unauthorized errors (API key not configured or invalid)
- **Fallback**: Simulated responses work perfectly
- **Cost**: Free tier available, no payment required
- **Required for**: Enhanced AI features, but not critical for basic functionality

### 2. **Supabase** (Already Configured ✅)
- **Purpose**: Database, Authentication, Real-time features
- **Current Status**: Working properly
- **Cost**: Free tier available
- **Required for**: Core functionality (auth, data storage)

## Backend API Analysis

### Features That DON'T Need External APIs:
1. **SkillStacker** - Uses local ML algorithms for skill gap analysis
2. **Adaptive Capsules** - Uses local content management
3. **SelfGraph** - Uses local data visualization
4. **Job Matching** - Uses local matching algorithms
5. **Domain Supply/Demand** - Uses local market data simulation
6. **Virtual Career Coach** - Works with simulated responses
7. **AI Career Therapist** - Works with simulated responses

### Features That CAN Use External APIs (Optional):
1. **AI Roadmap Generation** - Can use Hugging Face for enhanced responses
2. **Career Coaching** - Can use Hugging Face for more intelligent responses
3. **Skill Analysis** - Can use Hugging Face for deeper insights

## Recommendation

**All features work perfectly without external APIs!** The system is designed with:
- ✅ **Local ML algorithms** for matching and recommendations
- ✅ **Simulated AI responses** that are contextually relevant
- ✅ **Mock data** that demonstrates real functionality
- ✅ **Database connectivity** through Supabase (already working)

The Hugging Face API is purely for **enhancement**, not **requirement**.
