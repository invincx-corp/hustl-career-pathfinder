## 🚀 **How to Test in Browser**

### Step 1: Access the Application
1. Open browser and go to `http://localhost:5174/`
2. Navigate to **Curiosity Compass** page
3. Click **"Start Exploring Careers"** button

### Step 2: Complete the 4-Step Process
1. **Step 1 - Explore Career Domains**:

   - Use search bar to find additional domains
   - Click "Next"

   - Use search bar for more topics
   - Click "Next"

4. **Step 4 - Review Your Selections**:
   - Review all your selections
   - Click **"Generate My Roadmap"** button

### Step 3: Verify the Generation Process
1. **Button State Changes**:
   - Initial: "Generate My Roadmap" (enabled)
   - Loading: "Generating..." with spinner (disabled)
   - Success: "Generated!" (disabled)
   - Complete: Navigate to roadmaps page

2. **Console Logs** (Open Developer Tools):
   - `🚀 GENERATE ROADMAP BUTTON CLICKED!`
   - `Current selections: {...}`
   - `Generating roadmap with selections: {...}`
   - `Calling generatePersonalizedRoadmap with selections: {...}`
   - `Roadmap generation result: {...}`
   - `✅ Roadmap stored in database successfully: {...}` (if database works)
   - `Stored roadmap in localStorage, navigating to /roadmaps...`

3. **Navigation**:
   - Should automatically navigate to `/roadmaps` page
   - Should display the generated roadmap with all phases, projects, and assessments

### Step 4: Verify Roadmap Display
1. **Roadmap Page Should Show**:
   - "Your Paths" section with generated roadmaps
   - Detailed view with learning steps
   - Attached resources for each step
   - Project recommendations
   - Assessment plan
   - AI insights (learning style, market demand, personalization score)

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### If Button Doesn't Work:
1. Check console for errors
2. Ensure you've selected at least one domain in Step 1
3. Ensure you've selected at least one topic in Step 3
4. Check if button is disabled (should show "Generating..." during process)

### If Database Errors Occur:
- This is expected for anonymous users
- Roadmap will still be generated and stored locally
- Check console for "Continuing with roadmap generation despite database error..."

### If Navigation Doesn't Work:
- Check if `/roadmaps` route exists in the app
- Verify the roadmaps page is properly implemented
- Check console for navigation errors
